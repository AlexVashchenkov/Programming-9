The following characters are considered as blanks: space, horizontal tabulation, carriage return, line feed and form feed. 
Blanks are ignored, but they separate adjacent identifiers, literals and keywords that would otherwise be confused as one single identifier, literal or keyword.

Comments

Comments are introduced by the two characters (*, with no intervening blanks, and terminated by the characters *), with no intervening blanks. 
Comments are treated as blank characters. 
Comments do not occur inside string or character literals. 
Nested comments are handled correctly.
